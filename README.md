# PyBer Analysis
## Challenge 5: Matplotlib
### Overview
#### Purpose
This challenge analysis was based on the results from merging two .csv files into one dataframe. The two files contained the following information:
1. City Data: this data included the names of cities, how many drivers are in each city, and the type of city: urban, suburban, and rural.
2. Rider Data: this data included a date and timestamp for each ride, the cost of each ride, a ride identification to distinguish each ride, and the city that the ride took place.
When merging this data together, we are able to analyze:
1. How many rides took place per city and the average amount of rides per city type
2. How many drivers there are per city and the average amount of drivers per city type
3. How much fare collected per city and the average fare per city type

Our merged DataFrame is below:

#### Additional analysis
In addition, we took a look at a segment of data produced across 4 months: January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019. This data was then plotted onto a multi-line chart with results per week.

Our multiline chart is below:
